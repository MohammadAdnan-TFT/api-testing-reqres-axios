# API Testing with Jest
This repository contains a set of test scripts for API requests using [https://reqres.in/](https://reqres.in/). It utilizes Jest for automation testing.

## Prerequisites
Before running the test scripts, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Node.js: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

## Test Scenarios
I have created test scenarios for various HTTP methods, including:
POST
GET
PUT
DELETE
PATCH

These scenarios validate the functionality of the API endpoints and ensure that the responses meet your expectations.

## Custom HTTP Request Methods
To make the test scripts more maintainable and reusable, I have implemented custom HTTP request methods. These methods accept the necessary data to make HTTP calls and are used in the test scripts.

## JSDoc Documentation
I have included JSDoc comments in the code to provide documentation for the custom HTTP request methods and other important functions or classes.

## Assertions
Assertions are used throughout the test scripts to validate the responses from the API. These assertions ensure that the expected data matches the actual data received from the API.
